						<h3>Dan Christian Llaneta</h3>
						<p class="designation">Database Engineer &middot; AWS</p>
						<p>
							Siva's depth and breadth of experience in Oracle database technologies have been key to the success of the DB team in Markit. He was looked up to in a team of experienced DBA's for elegant solutions to a wide scope of database problems, especially for performance issues in an environment where &gt;10TB databases are the norm.
							It was motivating to see how he dealt with performance and availability issues in such a calm and collected manner and how methodical and sensible his approaches are.
							I would definitely recommend Siva and it was a pleasure to have worked with him.
